# UPDATE_PLAN_FOR_LLM.md — Canonical LLM Session Handoff

Last updated: 2026-07-10 (contributor pipeline; previous: architecture cleanup + Vite migration).
Read `AGENTS.md` first — it is the authoritative architecture guide. This file
tracks session-to-session status, decisions, and next tasks.

## Contributor pipeline implementation (2026-07-10)

- Added the standalone website's Supabase/Vercel contributor, sentence-review,
  immutable submission, language moderation, administration, notification, and
  publication architecture under `fydor-website/`.
- Supabase server access now includes Drizzle ORM over the shared transaction-mode
  pooler (`prepare: false`), a typed schema mirror, and Drizzle Kit tooling. The
  public library uses that connection; protected Supabase Auth/RPC operations
  remain on the service-role REST boundary so database role claims are preserved.
- Generation is intentionally manual chat handoff only: versioned prompt + copy
  + allowlisted ChatGPT/Claude website. There is no provider API or BYOK key.
- Added canonical hostile-JSON validation, database-backed roles and transition
  functions, public library API/UI, secure ignored bootstrap runbook and CLI.
- Desktop SQLite migration 6 marks existing lessons personal and records
  published-install provenance. Exchange now downloads published versions,
  verifies SHA-256 in Rust, revalidates, detects updates, and preserves unchanged
  study progress. External URLs use the official Tauri opener through a narrow
  allowlisted Rust command.
- See `docs/contributor-pipeline.md` and
  `fydor-website/docs/contributor-pipeline.md` for boundaries and deployment.

## Architecture Cleanup (2026-07-08, later session)

- **Dead code removed** (verified with knip + grep before each deletion):
  - Client-side FSRS "engine seam" that production never used: `lib/review/fsrs.ts`,
    `lib/review/schedulerEngine.ts`, `lib/review/reviewableUnit.ts` + their tests.
    FSRS lives only in `src-tauri/src/review.rs` now; `lib/review/scheduler.ts` is
    just the optimistic client mirror for the fixed-interval intervals.
  - Write-only settings subsystem: `src-tauri/src/settings.rs` + `saveUserSettings`
    (nothing could ever read a saved setting — there was no `get_user_settings`).
    The `user_settings` table is kept in `db.rs` for migration safety.
  - `lib/imported-content/exercise-generators.ts` (no production consumers),
    `scripts/generate-icons.mjs` + the `sharp` devDependency.
  - ~270 lines of dead CSS rules/vars in `src/globals.css` (43 rules verified
    unreferenced, including dynamic `prefix-${...}` class patterns).
- **Quiz modes consolidated**: FillBlankMode + MultipleChoiceMode previously
  duplicated an entire quiz state machine each. Shared engine now lives in
  `components/imported-content/quizSession.ts` (`useQuizSession`: setup/active/
  complete flow, scoring, session persistence, keyboard shortcuts) and
  `QuizShell.tsx` (setup/complete/feedback/nav panels). Each mode supplies only
  its card type, pool builder, correctness fn, and active-question UI.
  Persisted progress shapes and localStorage keys are unchanged.
- **ConfirmDialog extracted** to `components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx`; all five
  confirm dialogs (quiz exit, draft replace, lesson delete, review resets) use it.
- **review.rs**: the duplicated 21-column sentence SELECT is now the shared
  `REVIEW_SENTENCE_SELECT` const (column order must match `map_review_sentence`).
- Verification after each step: typecheck, eslint, vitest (91 tests — 24 removed
  tests were exercising the deleted dead modules), `cargo test` (24), `vite build`.
- LOC: 22,675 → ~21,100 (TS/TSX/Rust/CSS under src, components, lib, src-tauri,
  tests, scripts).

## Second-Pass Review (2026-07-08, same day)

Principal-engineer style re-review of the cleanup above. Changes:

- **Legacy review-queue path deleted**: `buildReviewQueue`, `buildReviewQueueWithCurrent`,
  `buildLegacyReviewQueue`, `hydrateReviewSentence`, and the `ReviewSentenceRow` type
  (Date-typed rows) were reachable only from tests — production always goes
  `get_review_queue` (Rust, strings) → `buildInterleavedReviewQueue`. Also removed the
  tests-only `buildTargetedReviewQueue` wrapper (tests now compose
  `buildInterleavedReviewQueue` + `itemTargetToQueueEntry`, same as ReviewDeck) and the
  duplicate `scoreAnyReviewSentence`/`scoreReviewSentence` pair.
- **`getReviewShortcutAction` moved** from `queue.ts` to `lib/review/keyboard.ts` — it is
  a keyboard concern; queue.ts is now purely ordering.
- **Orphaned module deleted**: `lib/imported-content/coverage.ts` (+ its test) had zero
  production imports — it was stranded when `exercise-generators.ts` was removed.
- **`isEditableShortcutTarget` deduplicated**: three identical copies (quizSession,
  useLessonReview, ImportedContentStudy) → one export in `lib/dom.ts`.
  (`keyboard.ts`'s `isInteractiveTarget` intentionally differs: it also ignores BUTTON.)
- **ReviewDeck start menu**: the two ~50-line duplicated menu JSX blocks are one
  `renderStartMenu(hasSentences)` helper. This also fixes a latent bug: in the
  "lessons selected but zero sentences" state the Reset Progress button opened a
  confirm dialog that branch never rendered.
- **CSS**: another ~145 lines of verified-dead rules removed (grouped-selector members
  and rules inside `@media` blocks the first pass missed). Dynamic
  `prefix-${...}` classes (cloze-kind-*, review-heatmap-*, token-fam-*, review-state-*,
  tooltip-*, status-*) re-verified as live and kept.
- **Deliberately NOT changed** (assessed, judged correct as-is):
  - Rust FSRS in `review.rs` is live policy (`NEW_CARD_SCHEDULER_ENGINE = "fsrs"`): new
    cards start on FSRS, previously graded rows keep fixed-interval. Well-tested; keep.
  - `lib/review/scheduler.ts` optimistic mirror only models fixed-interval; for FSRS
    cards the optimistic dueAt is wrong for a few ms until the server row replaces it.
    Accepted trade-off — grading stays instant and the server is authoritative.
  - `SchedulerEngineId` keeps "fsrs" (Rust returns it).
  - Rust import pipeline (`lessons/import.rs`) is cleanly staged (parse → plan →
    preview/apply); no change.

## Current Architecture (post-Vite migration)

- **Frontend**: Vite 7 + React 19 SPA. Entry: `index.html` → `src/main.tsx` →
  `src/App.tsx` (React Router `HashRouter` route table). No Next.js remains.
- **Routing**: hash-based (`/#/lessons/manage`). Chosen so the static Tauri
  bundle (single `index.html` in `dist/`) deep-links without server rewrites.
  `/` and unknown paths redirect to `/lessons/manage`.
- **Error handling**: `src/ErrorBoundary.tsx` wraps the router (replaces Next's
  `error.tsx`/`global-error.tsx`).
- **Backend**: unchanged — Tauri 2 + Rust + SQLite (`src-tauri/`). All data via
  `lib/desktopApi.ts` → `invoke()`. `frontendDist: ../dist`, dev on port 3001
  (`scripts/tauri-dev.mjs` picks a free port and overrides config for dev).
- **State**: plain React state; UI/session persistence via `lib/storage.ts`
  (zod-validated localStorage). Review/scheduling truth lives in SQLite only.
- **Modes** = routes. Switching modes unmounts the previous mode's components;
  each mode persists exactly its own storage key(s) (`review.deck`,
  `review.selected-lessons`, `reading.position`, `app-shell`, quiz results).
  There is no shared mutable mode state to go stale.

## Completed Work (this session, 2026-07-08)

1. **Next.js → Vite migration** (commit `Migrate desktop frontend from Next.js to Vite + React`):
   - Removed `app/`, `next.config.ts`, `next-env.d.ts`, `out/`, Next deps.
   - `app/*/page.tsx` thin shells → routes in `src/App.tsx`; `app/review/page.tsx`
     → `src/pages/ReviewPage.tsx`; learning-science → `src/pages/LearningSciencePage.tsx`.
   - `next/link|navigation|image` → `react-router-dom` / `<img>` in: AppShell,
     GuidedTour, FydorExchangePage, ImportedContentWorkspace, FillBlankMode,
     MultipleChoiceMode, ReviewPage, LearningSciencePage.
   - All `"use client"` directives stripped.
   - ESLint: `eslint-config-next` → `typescript-eslint` + `react-hooks` flat
     config. `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (new in plugin v7) is disabled
     globally — it flags the codebase's load-then-set pattern everywhere;
     re-enable per-file if refactoring toward event-driven loads.
   - Vitest 2 → 4 (needed to share Vite 7). All 120 tests pass unchanged.
   - Tauri: `frontendDist ../dist`, window `url: index.html`.

2. **Reading Mode rebuilt** (commit `Rebuild Reading Mode as a lesson reader…`):
   - `components/reading/ReadingWorkspace.tsx` is now a tab shell:
     **Read lessons** (`LessonReader.tsx`, new, primary) and **Analyze text**
     (`TextAnalyzer.tsx`, the former paste-in workbench, unchanged logic).
   - LessonReader: lesson list → full sentence-by-sentence reader in stored
     order, annotation tooltips via `AnnotatedSentence`, per-sentence + global
     translation toggles, speech audio, keyboard nav (↓/j, ↑/k, t, Esc),
     position persisted under `reading.position`.
   - Strictly read-only: uses only `getLessons`/`getLessonCached`; cannot touch
     review scheduling.
   - Pure nav helpers in `lib/reading/readerNavigation.ts` + tests
     (`tests/unit/reading-reader.test.ts`).

3. **Review system audited, no code changes needed**: the 2026-07-08 overhaul
   (see `docs/fydor-next-implementation-plan.md`) already covers determinism
   (seeded queue RNG), double-grade protection (`reviewInFlightRef`), mixed
   sentence+item sessions (`item:<id>` key namespace), FSRS-for-new-cards
   policy, daily new-card cap, append-only `review_events`. 24 Rust tests +
   review vitest suites pass.

## Build / Test Status

- `npm run typecheck` ✅  `npm test` ✅ (17 files / 120 tests)
- `npm run lint` ✅  `npm run build` ✅ (dist/, ~510 kB JS chunk)
- `cargo test` (src-tauri) ✅ 24 tests
- `npm run tauri:dev` launches the app against the Vite dev server.

## Database Migration Status

Schema at migration 5 (`review_events`). No schema changes this session.
Nothing frontend-side touches migrations; migrating Next→Vite has zero effect
on user data (same SQLite file, same commands, same localStorage keys).

## Important Invariants (do not break)

- Hash routing: all internal links use React Router `Link to=` — never `<a href>`
  for internal routes (breaks under the tauri:// origin).
- `lib/desktopApi.ts` is the only `invoke()` call site.
- Queue key scheme: raw ids = sentences, `item:<id>` = items
  (`parseReviewTargetKey` null ⇒ sentence). Sentence-only sessions must remain
  byte-identical to the pre-item queue builder.
- LessonReader must stay read-only over review state.
- `lib/storage.ts` zod-validates every read; corrupt values degrade to null.
- Review interleaving ratios in `lib/review/queue.ts` are product decisions.

## Known Issues / Risks

- Single 510 kB JS chunk (warning only). Optional: manualChunks for
  react/lucide if startup ever feels slow — low priority for a desktop app.
- `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` disabled globally (see above).
- `docs/fydor-next-implementation-plan.md` is historical; this file +
  AGENTS.md are current.
- Release scripts (`scripts/release/*.sh`) call `npm run tauri:build`; they
  were not re-run this session — verify the DMG/NSIS pipeline on next release
  (frontendDist changed from `out/` to `dist/`).

## Recommended Next Tasks

1. Run `npm run tauri:build` end-to-end and smoke the packaged DMG (frontendDist change).
2. Consider highlighting known/learning items inside LessonReader sentences by
   reusing `get_reading_inputs` (analyzer already derives this knowledge).
3. Optional perf: manualChunks split; memo audit in `ReviewDeck` (826 lines —
   candidate for splitting menu vs. active-session subcomponents).
4. Re-enable `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` file-by-file when touching a
   component anyway.
